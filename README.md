### Some vertex information will be recorded in the additional UVs of PMX
**ðŸš¨Due to the difference between Unity's texture space and that of MMD, all UVs, except for vertex colors, have had their Y-coordinates flipped.**

| Unity | PMX |
| ----- | ----- |
| UV | UV |
| UV2 | Extra UV1 |
| UV3 | Extra UV2 |
| Vertex Color | Extra UV3 |
